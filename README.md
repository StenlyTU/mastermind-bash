# Mastermind with Bash

A project I did to consolidate my learning of Bash fundamentals.

To play:

```
git clone git@github.com:tjjjwxzq/mastermind-bash.git
cd mastermind-bash
chmod +x logos main
./main
```

Even better, make a symlink in your `$HOME/bin` directory and play it from anywhere!

```
cd ~/bin
ln -s /path/to/mastermind-bash/main mastermind
mastermind
```
